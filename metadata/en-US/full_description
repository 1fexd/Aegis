Aegis Authenticator is a free, secure and open source app to manage your
2-step verification tokens for your online services.

'''Encryption'''
All of your one-time passwords are stored in a vault. If you choose
to set a password, which is highly recommended, the vault will be encrypted
using AES-256. If someone with malicious intent gets a hold of the vault file,
itâ€™s impossible for them to retrieve the contents without knowing the password.

'''Fingerprint unlock'''
Entering your password each time you need access to a
one-time password can be cumbersome. Fortunately, you can also enable
fingerprint unlock if your device has a fingerprint scanner.

'''Compatibility'''
Aegis supports the HOTP and TOTP algorithms. These two algorithms are
industry-standard and widely supported, making Aegis compatible with
thousands of services. Some examples are: Google, GitHub, Dropbox, Facebook
and Instagram.

It is also compatible with Google Authenticator. Any website that shows a QR
code for Google Authenticator also works with Aegis.

'''Groups'''
Have a lot of one-time passwords? Add them to custom groups for easier
access. Personal, Work and Social can each get their own group.

'''Backups'''
To make sure you will never lose access to your online accounts Aegis
Authenticator supports exporting your vault which you can import onto a new
device. Aegis Authenticator also allows you to import AndOTP and FreeOTP
databases so switching to Aegis is made easier for you.
